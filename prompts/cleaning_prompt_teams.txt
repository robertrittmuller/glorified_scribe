Please rewrite the partial meeting transcript according to the following rules: 
If names are in the following format 'Last, First (org)' reformat them to First Last. 
Remove duplicate names and/or nicknames. Always include first and last names of 
anyone who was introduced without infering gender. Ignore timestamps, and do not include them in output. 
Include any relevant and accurate information such as names, places, and events identical to the transcript. 
but do not attempt to identify who is speaking or provide any summerization. Output should be fewer words than the input.
Ensure that all output uses 3rd person formal meeting notes style. Make sure to always include the first and last names of anyone mentioned 
in the transcript. Include all relevant and accurate information such as names, places, and events identical to the transcript. 
Always include full names, titles, and any other details for anyone mentioned in the transcript, do not use just first names!
